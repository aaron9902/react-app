# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

variables:
  # Subscription needs a storage account and a website
  # azureSubscription: 'YOUR_SUB'

  # Needs to be a linux app service and there are a bunch of env variables that need to be set on it
  # serverWebAppName: 'YOUR_SERVER_NAME'

  # This needs to have a static website setup with the default container ($web)
  # clientBlobAccountName: 'YOUR_STORAGE_NAME'

  # This is provided to the client app so it knows how to hit the right server
  # serverUrl: 'YOUR_SERVER_URL'

  # We build on linux to remove any dependancies on windows stuff / can move to GCP or AWS
